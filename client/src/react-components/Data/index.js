Infants and young children are especially vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases because their immune systems are less mature, and therefore less able to fight off infection. In infants and young children, these diseases can cause serious illness, long-term disability, and even death. Vaccines provide the best and safest protection against these diseases. Learn about what vaccines your child needs and when, why our child needs to get vaccinated on time, and how to prepare for a better immunization experience.",

Childhood vaccines protect against diseases that can cause serious illness, long-term disability, and death. You can find B.C.\'s routine immunization schedule for infants and young children here. Many vaccines require more than one dose to produce immunity and long-lasting protection. Your child should get the recommended number of doses of each vaccine, on schedule, to be fully protected.Children with chronic health conditions may need additional vaccines or additional doses of a vaccine. If your child has a chronic condition, talk to your doctor or public health nurse about their vaccination schedule.

It’s important to read all of the information in the package and to sign the consent form and return it to your child’s school. Call your local health unit or speak with your doctor if you have any questions. It’s recommended that parents or guardians and their children discuss consent for immunizations. However, children under the age of 19 who are able to understand the benefits and possible reactions for each vaccine, and the risk of not getting immunized, can legally consent to or refuse immunizations.

This is important because some vaccines cannot be given during pregnancy but provide important protection. For example, the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine should not be given during pregnancy, but rubella infection during pregnancy can cause miscarriage and serious birth defects. If you are planning to become pregnant, talk to your health care provider about vaccines you may need. It’s also a good idea to make sure that everyone in your household is up to date with their vaccines. This will help protect your baby by lowering the chance of household members getting a disease and passing it onto your baby. This is especially important because babies don’t start getting vaccines until they are two months old, and most vaccines require more than one dose. This means that newborn babies are especially vulnerable to disease.

Travellers may require additional doses or booster doses of routine vaccines or may need to receive their vaccines on a different schedule. For example, if you are travelling with an infant, your infant may need to get certain vaccines early.

The following is a simple guide to help you remember their definitions: Vaccines are products that produce immunity to a specific disease. When you are immune to a disease, it means you are protected against that disease (you can be exposed to it without becoming sick). Most vaccines are given by injection (needle), but some are given orally (by mouth) or nasally (sprayed into the nose). Vaccination is the act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce immunity to a specific disease. Immunization is the process by which a person or animal becomes protected against a disease. This term is often used interchangeably with vaccination. ',
        title3: 'Important Note:',
        content3: 'Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent diseases. A vaccine helps the body’s immune system to recognize and fight pathogens like viruses or bacteria, which then keeps us safe from the diseases they cause. Vaccines protect against more than 25 debilitating or life-threatening diseases, including measles, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, meningitis, influenza, tetanus, typhoid and cervical cancer',

        title1: 'How do vaccines work?',
        content1: 'Vaccines give you immunity to a disease without you getting sick first. They are made using killed or weakened versions of the disease-causing germ or parts of the germ (called antigens). For some vaccines, genetic engineering is used to make the antigens used in the vaccine. It’s much safer to get a vaccine than to get the disease it prevents.',
        title2: 'Your immune system',
        content2: 'Your immune system is made up of a specialized network of organs, cells, and tissues that all work together to help protect you against disease. When a disease-causing germ (for example, a virus or bacteria) enters your body, your immune system: Recognizes the germ as being foreign (not belonging in the body); Responds by making special proteins (called antibodies) that help destroy the germ. Most of the time, your immune system can’t act fast enough to stop the germ from making you sick. But by destroying the germ, it can usually help you get well again; Remembers the germ that made you sick and how to destroy it. That way, if you are ever exposed to the same disease germ in the future, your immune system can quickly destroy it before it has a chance to make you sick. This protection is called immunity.',
        title3: 'Vaccines and your immune system',
        content3: 'When you get a vaccine, your immune system responds to the vaccine the same way it would to the real germ. It: Recognizes the germ in the vaccine as being foreign. Responds by making antibodies to the germ in the vaccine, just as it would for the real germ. Remembers the germ and how to destroy it. That way, if you are ever exposed to the disease-causing germ in the future, your immune system will be able to quickly destroy it before it has a chance to make you sick. This is how you get immunity from vaccines.' ,
        content4: 'Our immune systems are designed to remember. Once exposed to one or more doses of a vaccine, we typically remain protected against a disease for years, decades or even a lifetime. This is what makes vaccines so effective. Rather than treating a disease after it occurs, vaccines prevent us in the first instance from getting sick.',

        content2: 'Many of the diseases vaccines prevent are now rarely seen in Canada, mostly because of vaccine programs. But the germs that cause these diseases still exist, and we still see some of these diseases such as pertussis (whooping cough), measles, and mumps in small numbers in Canada. If vaccination rates drop, these small numbers of diseases could quickly become outbreaks and epidemics of disease. Also, many of the diseases that are now rarely seen in Canada, such as polio, diphtheria, and measles, are still quite common in other countries. These diseases are only a plane ride away. Without protection from vaccines, these diseases would spread quickly, and outbreaks would occur.',
        title3: 'Vaccines protect everyone',
        content3: 'Vaccines don\'t just protect the people getting vaccinated; they protect everyone around them too. The more people in a community who are vaccinated, the harder it is for a disease to spread. If a person infected with a disease comes in contact only with people who are immune (have been vaccinated), the disease will have little opportunity to spread. The type of protection created when most people are vaccinated is called “herd immunity." It means that many of us are protecting each other, and especially the most vulnerable among us.',
        content4: 'Vaccines also protect future generations. Just like we are no longer at risk of smallpox, thanks to vaccines, in the future, we may be able to wipe out other diseases, like polio and measles.
